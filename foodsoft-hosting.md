So you want to start a food cooperative? Or you're already part of one, but
would like to have a ordering system that supports what you're doing? Foodsoft
is a web-based software package offering a product catalog, ordering,
accounting, and job scheduling features.

When you'd like to start using Foodsoft, you can request an instance for your
cooperative at one of the hosting providers. Or if you have some technical skills,
you can also run it yourself.

## Austria

There's quite a number of food cooperatives in Austria using Foodsoft. Feel free
to contact if you're interested.

## Netherlands

Several groups in The Netherlands share a
[server](https://order.voedselcollectief.org) to run a modified version of
Foodsoft (the [foodcoop-adam fork](https://github.com/foodcoop-adam/foodsoft)).
This adds a more user-friendly member ordering interface, online payments,
signup, nested article categories, a checkout screen and other improvements. It
is based on an older version of Foodsoft though, and doesn't provide the
delivery and task functionality.

## Do-It-Yourself

Since Foodsoft is open source, you can always run your own copy. This requires
some technical skills, but allows you to make your own tweaks and modifications.
And if you need help, the [mailing list](http://foodsoft.51229.x6.nabble.com/foodsoft-discuss-f5.html)
is always there.
